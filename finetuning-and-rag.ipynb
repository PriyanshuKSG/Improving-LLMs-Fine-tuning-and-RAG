If\nthe body is so extended that g varies fr om part\nto part of the body, then the centr e of gravity\nand centr e of mass will not coincide. Basically,\nthe two ar e different concepts. The centr e of\nmass has nothing to do with gravity. It depends\nonly on the distribution of mass of the body.\nIn Sec. 7.2 we found out the position of the\ncentr e of mass of several r egular , homogeneous\nobjects. Obviously the method used ther e gives\nus also the centr e of gravity of these bodies, if\nthey ar e small enough.\nFigur e 7.25 illustrates another way of\ndeter mining the CG of an r egular shaped body\nlike a car dboar d. If you suspend the body fr om\nsome point like A, the vertical line thr ough A\npasses thr ough the CG. W e mark the vertical\nAA1. We then suspend the body thr ough other\npoints like B and C. The intersection of the\nverticals gives the CG. Explain why the method\nworks. Since the body is small enough, the\nmethod allows us to deter mine also its centr e\nof mass.\nExample 7.8   A metal bar 70 cm long\nand 4.00 kg in mass supported on two\nknife-edges placed 10 cm fr om each end.\nA 6.00 kg load is suspended at 30 cm fr om\none end. Find the r eactions at the knife-\nedges. (Assume the bar to be of unifor m\ncross section and homogeneous.)\nAnswer\nFig. 7.26\nFigur e 7.26 shows the r od AB, the positions\nof the knife edges K1 and K2 , the centr e of\ngravity of the r od at G and the suspended load\nat P.\nNote the weight of the r od W acts at its\ncentr e of gravity G. The r od is unifor m in cr oss\nsection and homogeneous; hence G is at the\ncentr e of the r od; AB = 70 cm. AG = 35 cm, AP\n= 30 cm, PG = 5 cm, AK1= BK2 = 10 cm and K1G\n= K2G = 25 cm. Also, W= weight of the r od =4.00 kg and W1= suspended load = 6.00 kg;\nR1 and R2 are the nor mal r eactions of the\nsupport at the knife edges.\nFor translational equilibrium of the r od,\nR1+R2 –W1 –W = 0 (i)\nNote W1 and W act vertically down and R1\nand R2 act vertically up.\nFor considering r otational equilibrium, we\ntake moments of the for ces. A convenient point\nto take moments about is G. The moments of\nR2 and W1 are anticlockwise (+ve), wher eas the\nmoment of R1 is clockwise (-ve).\nFor rotational equilibrium,\n–R1 (K1G) + W1 (PG) + R2 (K2G) = 0 (ii)\nIt is given that W = 4.00 g N and W1 = 6.00 g\nN, wher e g = acceleration due to gravity. W e\ntake g = 9.8 m/s2.\nWith numerical values inserted, fr om (i)\nR1 + R2 – 4.00 g – 6.00 g = 0\nor R1 + R2 = 10.00 g  N (iii)\n               = 98.00 N\nFrom (ii), – 0.25 R1 + 0.05 W1 + 0.25 R2 = 0\nor R1 – R2 = 1.2 g  N = 11.76 N (iv)\nFrom (iii) and (iv), R1 = 54.88 N,\nR2 = 43.12 N\nThus the r eactions of the support ar e about\n55 N at K1 and 43 N at K2.  ◁\nExample 7.9  A 3m long ladder weighing\n20 kg leans on a frictionless wall. Its feet\nrest on the floor 1 m fr om the wall as shown\nin Fig.7.27. Find the r eaction for ces of the\nwall and the floor .\nAnswer\nFig. 7.27\nThe ladder AB is 3 m long, its foot A is at\ndistance AC = 1 m fr om the wall.
